### Eye blink detection using dlib and OpenCV
#### What is eye aspect ratio (EAR)?
From the last project - Detecting facial landmarks - we know that we can apply facial landmark detection to localize important regions of the face, including eyes, eyebrows, nose, ears, and mouth. This also implies that we can extract specific facial structures by knowing the indexes of the particular face parts. In terms of blink detection, we are only interested in two sets of facial structures â€” the eyes.
